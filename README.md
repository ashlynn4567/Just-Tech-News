This is my tenth project for the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp 2022. In this project, I will use Sequelize and Object Relational Mapping (ORM) to help facilitate a back-end server for the social media platform, Hacker News. I will also use Handlebars.js as a templating language to help create the front-end to follow the MVC Paradigm.
